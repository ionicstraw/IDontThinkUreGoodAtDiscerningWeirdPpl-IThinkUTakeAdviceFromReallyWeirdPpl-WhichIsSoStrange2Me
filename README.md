# IDontThinkUreGoodAtDiscerningWeirdPpl-IThinkUTakeAdviceFromReallyWeirdPpl-WhichIsSoStrange2Me

if someone is talking about MY PERSONAL life in a PROFESSIONAL setting, that is a weird person, u should have always known that

if someone is coercing u to live ur PERSONAL life in a certain way, in a PROFESSIONAL setting, in fking NYC of all places, that's a weird person ... u know that right?

i think i have to be like ur mother something and ure a little kid or something and give u specific orders and be like "dont talk to that person, that's a weird fking person" or "that's some freak dont listen to them"

did u really or did u guys really listen to hannah about ANYTHING, her job at richards was to legit, literally clean the coffee machine, she would literally do that and i dunno her. u know whats funny, she was actually not good at cleaning the coffee machine, like my coworker would have to help her. the machine would jam or something and the filter needed to be replaced and there were times she couldnt fix it so that person had to do it.

someone has their hands in their pants, man or woman, obsesively talking about me, and ure taking their advice -- yeah good, thats going to turn out well. thats some freak in a back alley, dont listen to them

i have learned this only very recently, but genuinely understand this. ur job does not define u. i always thought it did.
