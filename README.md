# IDontThinkUreGoodAtDiscerningWeirdPpl-IThinkUTakeAdviceFromReallyWeirdPpl-WhichIsSoStrange2Me

if someone is talking about MY PERSONAL life in a PROFESSIONAL setting, that is a weird person, u should have always known that

if someone is coercing u to live ur PERSONAL life in a certain way, in a PROFESSIONAL setting, in fking NYC of all places, that's a weird person ... u know that right?

i think i have to be like ur mother something and ure a little kid or something and give u specific orders and be like "dont talk to that person, that's a weird fking person" or "that's some freak dont listen to them"

did u really or did u guys really listen to hannah about ANYTHING, her job at richards was to legit, literally clean the coffee machine, she would literally do that and i dunno her

someone has their hands in their pants, man or woman, obsesively talking about me, and ure taking their advice -- yeah good, thats going to turn out well. thats some freak in a back alley, dont listen to them
